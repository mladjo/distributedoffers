# Points Distributed Offers

## Introduction

The following demo application provides a proof-of-concept for the distributed offers scenario supported by Points' BGT 3 product. Distributed offers are a new feature of the BGT 3 product, built on Points' proprietary Loyalty Commerce Platform, which allows third-parties, including loyalty program IT, to directly integrate with and leverage rich BGT offers as configured by the Points' Delivery team on behalf of our valued partners.

With this capability, third-parties can dynamically display enticing, relevant, and personalized offers to LP members in any format â€” mobile apps, websites, banners, video ads, etc. 

## Demo

You can see a live demo at [distributedoffers.heroku.com](http://distributedoffers.heroku.com).
